# Airbnb Dataset

This **repository is the second in a series of three** in which various Airbnb datasets are studied using different analysis methods.

- [Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/ignareyesa/airbnb_eda)
- [Part 2: Natural Language Processing on reviews](https://github.com/ignareyesa/airbnb_nlp)
- [Part 3: Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/ignareyesa/airbnb_ts)

Airbnb is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via website and mobile app. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking.

### Airbnb Data
The data used in this series is collected by [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com), and the study is mainly focus in Madrid, Spain until February 2020 (pre-Covid19)

The dataset consists on the following files:
| File Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| listings.csv.gz | Detailed Listings data. |
| calendar.csv.gz | Detailed Calendar Data. |
| reviews.csv.gz | Detailed Review Data. |
| listings.csv | Summary information and metrics for listings in Madrid. |
| reviews.csv | Summary Review data and Listing ID. |
| neighbourhoods.csv | Neighbourhood list for geo filter. Sourced from city or open source GIS files. |

## Part 2:

This repository consists on one Jupyter Notebook. 

In this part of the project, the analysis of customer feedback will be carried out using **Natural Processing Language techniques with the Python programming language**.

We start by **identifying the most used languages**🇬🇧🇪🇸🇺🇸🇨🇳🇮🇹🇫🇷 and the most used words in these languages.

Subsequently, **sentiment analysis** is carried out on the comments, dividing them into positive😁, neutral😌 and negative😡.

Finally, different methods are used to carry out **topic modelling🔦** on the comments already separated into sentiments. 

All of these techniques are explored in greater depth to find patterns of behaviour that can help in **data-driven decision making💭**.

So, please feel free to take your time to look deeper into the code and conclusions.
